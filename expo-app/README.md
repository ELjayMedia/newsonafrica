# News On Africa iOS App

This folder contains a minimal React Native Expo application that fetches posts from the News On Africa API.

## Development

1. Install the Expo CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd expo-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app in iOS simulator:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

The app fetches data from `https://app.newsonafrica.com/api/posts` and displays the post titles in a list.
